# Holberton _printf Project
## DESCRIPTION
The program produce outputs according to specific formats. It writes the output under a control of one or more format specifiers that tell how subsequent arguments are converted for output.

## Format specifiers:
**-tag -width -indent** 
- **s** -  Represents a substring to insert instead
- **c** - Inserts a character in place of the specifier
- **d** - Inserts a string representing the integers
- **i** - Converts an integer to a substring and inserts in place
- **x** - converts an input integer to hexadecimal and puts it in place
- **o** - converts an input integer to octal base and returns a substring
 - **%** - converts an input integer to a percentage and returs the substring

## FLAGS
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any.  The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary  characters (not  %),  which  are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.

Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier.  In between there may be (in this order) zero or more  flags,  an  optional  minimum  field
width, an optional precision and an optional length modifier.

### A list of flags and their descriptions:
**-tag -width -indent**   Differs from above in tag removed
- **a** - a flag as a list item
